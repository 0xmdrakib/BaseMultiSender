1/ 🚀 Built: Base MultiSender — a non-custodial batch sender on Base.

Send ETH or ERC20 to hundreds/thousands of wallets fast.
No protocol fee — you only pay network gas.

Try this: https://multisender.online

2/ ✅ Modes
• ETH batch send
• ERC20 batch send (Permit2)
• Strict mode = atomic (all-or-nothing). If any transfer fails, the tx reverts.

3/ 🎯 Made for creators & communities
Perfect for:
• Creator token distribution
• Airdrops (whitelist/community rewards)
• Bounties / contributors payouts
• Payroll for DAOs
• Quest rewards / campaign payouts

4/ 📄 CSV power flow
Upload CSV → auto-parse → review totals → send.
Includes copy buttons, explorer links, and clear receipts for each successful transaction.

5/ 🔐 ERC20 UX (safer approvals)
Approve EXACT batch total (not unlimited), then sign + send.
This avoids “infinite approval” risk and keeps permissions minimal.

6/ 🧩 Large lists handled professionally
If recipients > 500, it auto-splits into multiple txs:
Example: 1400 → 500 / 500 / 400
So transactions stay reliable instead of failing from big payloads.

7/ 📊 Transparency (no confusion)
During multi-part sends, users see:
• Total parts (e.g., 3 txs)
• Current part progress (1/3, 2/3…)
• A receipt per part, each with its own tx hash

8/ 📱 Mobile-friendly UI
Works cleanly on both phone + desktop, with a smooth wallet UX using RainbowKit custom connect button.

9/ ❤️ Bonus
Built-in Tip button (Base ETH) for supporting the developer.
Simple presets + custom amount.

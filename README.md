🚀 Built: Base MultiSender — a non-custodial batch sender on Base. Also it's a mini app on https://x.com/base & https://x.com/farcaster_xyz and this is my 10th Mini app.

• Send ETH or ERC20 to hundreds/thousands of wallets fast.
• No protocol fee — you only pay network gas.

Try this: https://multisender.online

✅ Modes:
• ETH batch send
• ERC20 batch send (Permit2)
• Strict mode = atomic (all-or-nothing). If any transfer fails, the tx reverts.

🎯 Made for creators & communities
Perfect for:
• Creator token distribution
• Airdrops (whitelist/community rewards)
• Bounties / contributors payouts
• Payroll for DAOs
• Quest rewards / campaign payouts

📄 CSV power flow:
• Upload CSV → auto-parse → review totals → send.
• Includes copy buttons, explorer links, and clear receipts for each successful transaction.

🔐 ERC20 UX (safer approvals):
• Approve EXACT batch total (not unlimited), then sign + send.
• This avoids “infinite approval” risk and keeps permissions minimal.

🧩 Large lists handled professionally:
• If recipients > 500, it auto-splits into multiple txs. Example: 1400 → 500 / 500 / 400
• So transactions stay reliable instead of failing from big payloads.

📊 Transparency (no confusion) During multi-part sends, users see:
• Total parts (e.g., 3 txs)
• Current part progress (1/3, 2/3…)
• A receipt per part, each with its own tx hash
• Also the contract is verified you can check what's inside in contract

📱Mobile-friendly UI:
• Works cleanly on both phone + desktop.
• In mini app i added easy wallet connect feature and a clean UI.

⛽️You need to pay Only gas fee:
• Most of others bulk sender taking a huge protocol fee from user.
• And i built this with 0 protocol fee.
